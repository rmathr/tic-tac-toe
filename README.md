<h1 align="center" id="title">Tic-tac-toe</h1>

<p id="description">This project was part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. The main goal of this project was to build a tic-tac-toe game using JavaScript. In this game players first select the difficulty level of the computer (easy medium hard and impossible). The minimax algorithm was used to create the impossible difficulty. After selecting the difficulty the game starts with the player and the computer alternating movements on the gameboard. The first one to achieve three consecutive cells with the same value (X or O) wins the game. This project was made using HTML CSS and JavaScript. This project was made before I learned how to properly split code using modules.</p>
